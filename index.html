           <h2>About Me</h2>
           <div><p>Dafne Luna (she, her, hers, and ella in spanish) is a queer first-generation Mexican American from Southern California. She has background in Latinx student support, LGBTQ+ activism, and
            body liberation advocacy. Dafne earned a Gender Studies B.A. and Chicana/o/x and Central
            American Studies M.A from UCLA. Throughout her educational experience she worked on
            understanding the experience of fat LGBTQ+ Latinx people and how those intersections
            impacted their lives in academia, the workforce, and community. Additionally, she taught at
            UCLA and different community programs across Southern California and worked with the
            LGBTQ+ youth community in the San Francisco Bay Area.
            
            Dafne has worked at the University of Richmond for over two years as the inaugural Assistant
            Director for Latinx Student Support and Multicultural Programming within the Student Center for
            Equity and Inclusion. While in this position, Dafne has worked to identify the barriers to
            community development within the Latinx student population on campus. Through implementing
            Latinx focused ongoing programs such as dialogues, socials, workshops, and special events,
            sheâ€™s helped Latinx students develop a sense of empowerment and cultural affinity. Through her
            multicultural work, Dafne seeks to support multicultural student solidarity and cultural exchange
            to build capacity for self-efficacy and activism.</p></div>
